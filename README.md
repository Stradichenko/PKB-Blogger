## Table of Contents

## Introduction
The current project tries to ease the work associated with generating a personal website.
Initially the project is only thought to have a workflow for Neovim to generate in HUGO a PKM database as a static website with network tools for knowledge integration.; but we keep in mind the possibility to extend it to other workflows with other site generators and text editors (VSC and Emacs).

This project is separates into two components:
**Plugin**: which provides all the context needed for comfortable content creation of the blog;
**Template**: which takes the posts and renders the linked files as nodes in a network with tools based on graph theory and network analysis for inspection of useful associations.

## Requirements
This project is initially thought to work on GNU/Linux operating systems but further instructions will also be added.


## Introduction

This is a 2 part project that tries to create a workflow for a fluent static site generation and management using Personal Knowledge Management System (PKM) principles.

## Workflow
The roadmap of this project has many phases, all of them start with the idea of creating a PKM database using a text editor and then using the template to generate a static website which include network visualization of referenced individual notes and different tool for network analysis.
