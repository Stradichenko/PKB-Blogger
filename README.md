# PKB-blogger (DRAFT)
A project for seamless CMS-blog and information generation (initially in Neovim X HUGO).

**Authors**: Espitia S., Gary; Cantos G., Eduardo

## Introduction 
This is a 2 part project that tries to create a workflow for static site content generation with a self-made Content Management System (CMS) using Personal Knowledge Base (PKB) principles.
Firstly, is only thought as a CMS for Neovim to generate in HUGO a PKM database as a static website; Secondly, using a custom [template](https://github.com/Stradichenko/PKM-theme) with network tools for knowledge integration; 

This project is separates into two components:
**CMS**: which provides all the context needed for comfortable content creation of the blog; 
The project main concern is with the text editor Neovim but, we keep in mind the possibility to extend it to other workflows with other site generators and text editors (VSC and Emacs).

**Template**: made with the static site generator HUGO. The template takes the posts and renders the linked files as nodes in a network with tools based on graph theory and network analysis for inspection of useful associations.
