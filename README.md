## PKM-blogger (DRAFT)
A project for seamless PKM-blog generation (initially in Neovim X HUGO).

**Authors**: Espitia S., Gary; Cantos G., Eduardo

## Introduction
The current project tries to ease the work associated with generating a personal website.
This is a 2 part project that tries to create a workflow for a fluent static site generation and management using Personal Knowledge Management System (PKM) principles.
Initially is only thought to have a workflow for Neovim to generate in HUGO a PKM database as a static website with a template with network tools for knowledge integration.; But we keep in mind the possibility to extend it to other workflows with other site generators and text editors (VSC and Emacs).

This project is separates into two components:
**Plugin**: which provides all the context needed for comfortable content creation of the blog;
**Template**: which takes the posts and renders the linked files as nodes in a network with tools based on graph theory and network analysis for inspection of useful associations.
