## Introduction
The current project tries to ease the work associated with generating a personal website at the time it alllows 
This is a 2 part project that tries to create a workflow for a fluent static site generation a Content Management System (CMS) using Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) principles.
Firstly, is only thought as a CMS fir Neovim to generate in HUGO a PKM database as a static website; Secondly, using a template with network tools for knowledge integration; 
The project main concern is with the text editor Neovim but, we keep in mind the possibility to extend it to other workflows with other site generators and text editors (VSC and Emacs).

This project is separates into two components:
**CMS**: which provides all the context needed for comfortable content creation of the blog;
**Template**: which takes the posts and renders the linked files as nodes in a network with tools based on graph theory and network analysis for inspection of useful associations.
